<h2 align="center">How it works</h2>
<p align="center">This is simple website where user can create his own account, change settings of his account such as profile description status, image and more. Main idea is to store AI websites on my website
user is able to add his own website if there's no AI website in database, he can also see what websites he added and more. All of these stuff is stored in firebase realtime database so it's full-stack app.
